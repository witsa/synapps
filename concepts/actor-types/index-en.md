# Actor types

Each actor has a type that will determine its behavior, its specificity.

## Actor categories

Actor types are grouped into categories.

- **Disposition**

Disposition actors allow to arrange the other actors and to build the tree.

Their different specificities make it possible to embrace all the possibilities of interface layout.

The disposition actors form the skeleton of the scene and their *nesting* is a *basic principle* of Synapps. This is what allows to adapt to the operation mode of browsers and allows the adaptability of the interface to any type of screen size.

- **Display**

Display actors are dedicated to the presentation of information or even scene.

- **Interaction**

The user will be able to interact with the interaction actors like buttons or input areas.

- **Charts**

These actors are dedicated to the graphical representation of data. For now, there is only one: the gauge.

- **Composites**

Composites are actors that you can create from other actors. See the section dedicated to [composites](./composite.md).


- **REDY**

REDy actors are available in a synapp project for REDY and present the interfaces and components dedicated to this platform.
